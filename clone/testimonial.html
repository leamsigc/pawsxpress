                        <p>"Just wanted to write something about Paws Xpress, with Mary Sanders. I was in a real bind with being blown off
                            for a
                            ride to the Halifax Humane Society, so my dog (Kermit) could get his cast off. Then, I was hooked up with Paws
                            Xpress.
                            Mary was a terrific lady and a life saver. She picked me and Kermit up, brought me to his appointment and then
                            brought
                            us back home. I look forward to using her again for Kermit's next appointment. Thank you so much, Paws Xpress
                            (Mary
                            Sanders) for the great service!"</p>

                    <p>"I wish to share my testimonial of the professionalism from Mary Sanders, owner of Paws Xpress. With wanting a special
                    Cottie rabbit, Speedy, from St. Louis, MO, I knew I had to rely on several other people for her transport to Miami, FL.
                    I thought it might be a real challenge, but Mary helped provide the quickest pick-up arrangement for me. She agreed to
                    pick up Speedy in Daytona Beach, FL and traveled approximately two hours to Fort Pierce, FL to meet me. I could see
                    instantly that she was healthy and in good hands. Maryâ€™s excellent mapping skills and communication definitely helped
                    an expeditious hand-off! If anyone ever wants to talk to someone who has gone through transportation of their pets,
                    feel free to contact me. In summary, we have found Mary, owner of Paws Xpress, to be professional, accessible, caring,
                    knowledgeable, "switched on", "hands on" and delightful to do business with. I will be happy to recommend Mary and Paws
                    Xpress!"</p>

                    <p>"My baby, Cleopatra (Cleo) had her first and only baby yesterday. She looked very stressed so I had to get her help. My
                    dogs mean everything to me, but I had no transportation. When no one else would help us, I was referred to Paws Xpress.
                    Mary didn't hesitate in being available, giving urgent transport and emotional support while my baby girl was cared
                    for. She never made me feel like I was below everyone. Without Paws Xpress, I don't know what I would have done."

                    <p>"Thank you so much for taking care of my bunnies, Buki and Snickie, while I was in the hospital. It was such a comfort
                    to find that you could start caring for them immediately and continued until I got home. They were very well taken care
                    of and loved! I don't even think that they missed me, since you were there feeding them and giving them veggies,
                    treats, lots of love and attention, and even cleaning their litter boxes! You were there when I needed you and I really
                    appreciate that! It was very nice to know that my babies were being so well cared for and loved! I think you will do
                    very well with your business, Paws Xpress, because you are so reliable and honest, and you truly love the critters!
                    
                    Thank you so much!

                    <p>"We went on a trip to Europe and were gone 2 weeks. My cat had never stayed alone that long and I was a bit worried
                    about her. As soon as I met Mary from Paws Xpress I felt so much better. She loved up on kitty right away and had her
                    rubbing up against her by the time she left. I couldn't be happier with the service she provided. She came every other
                    day and spent time with Kit and it showed. Kit was happy and healthy when we returned. My plant looked great also. I
                    have been a pet groomer for 30 years and would leave any animal in Mary's caring and capable hands. She is a
                    blessing!!!
                    
                    Thank you so much!

                    <p>"While planning for a complicated international move, I found myself in need of someone to not only transport my three
                    cats from Daytona Beach to Orlando International Airport, but to ensure they made it to the Vet the day before for
                    their health certificates. If anything went wrong, it would be very expensive and difficult for me to fix as I'd
                    already left the country. Clearly, I needed someone that I could trust. From our first meeting, I could tell that Mary
                    was that person. The research and planning she did gave me the confidence that she was focused on ensuring everything
                    went to plan. She made sure I always knew what was going on and was of great assistance in addressing the issues that
                    inevitably come up in this kind of scenario. I would strongly recommend Paws Xpress to anyone who needs someone to take
                    care of their pet, no matter what the situation."

                    for 6 days, left us knowing that Abbi was truly in good hands. With you providing overnight stay, it allowed us to have
                    no concerns that her routine would be anything other then what she was used to. She enjoys her walks! You spoiled her
                    with more walks than usual. She now expects me to take her out for the added walks, not a problem as I can use the
                    exercise. Once again, thanks, and the next time we need a pet sitter, you will get the call pronto. We have several
                    friends who have pets and may need your services. We will pass your name and number to them."
